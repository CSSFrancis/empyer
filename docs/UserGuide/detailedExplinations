This section goes further into the methods for correcting and optimizing your data.  While ideally most of these
functions would work with minimal human interaction the reality of the situation is that whatever can go wrong will
inevitably go wrong.




.. math::

   C(\phi,k,n)= \frac{ <I(\theta,k,n)*I(\theta+\phi,k,n)>_\theta-<I(\theta,k,n)>^2}{<I(\theta,k,n)>^2}

Where :math:`\theta` is the entire :math:`2\pi` radians the that :math:`\phi` (the angle of correlation) is averaged
over. k is the radius of the reciporical space vector and n is the diffraction pattern number (assuming the correlation
is being calculated for a series of diffraction patterns)

While the Electron Microscope community has decided to use the terminology of angular correlations, what is being
calculated is in actuality the self-correlation as a function of angle instead of time.

As result efficient methods for convolution can be applied in which the actual computation occurring is:

.. math::

   C(\phi,k,n)=\frac{IFFT[FFT(I(\theta,k,n))_\theta * Conj(FFT(I(\theta,k,n)))_\theta]}{<I(\theta,k,n)>^2}

Which speeds up the calculation more than 100x
